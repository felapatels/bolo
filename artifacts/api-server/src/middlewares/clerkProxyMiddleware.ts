/**
 * Clerk Frontend API Proxy Middleware
 *
 * Proxies Clerk Frontend API requests through your domain, enabling Clerk
 * authentication on custom domains and .replit.app deployments without
 * requiring CNAME DNS configuration.
 *
 * AUTH CONFIGURATION: This project uses a self-managed Clerk instance
 * (free-bedbug-6.clerk.accounts.dev). To manage users, login providers,
 * OAuth credentials, or branding, log in to your Clerk dashboard at
 * https://dashboard.clerk.com.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * - Only active in production (Clerk proxying doesn't work for dev instances)
 * - Must be mounted BEFORE express.json() middleware
 *
 * Usage in app.ts:
 *   import { CLERK_PROXY_PATH, clerkProxyMiddleware } from "./middlewares/clerkProxyMiddleware";
 *   app.use(CLERK_PROXY_PATH, clerkProxyMiddleware());

/**
 * Returns the first effective public hostname for the given request,
 * preferring x-forwarded-host over the Host header so callers behind a
 * proxy see the original client-facing host.
 *
 * x-forwarded-host can take three shapes:
 *   - undefined (no proxy involved)
 *   - a single string (one proxy hop)
 *   - a comma-delimited string when an upstream appended rather than
 *     replaced the header (Node folds duplicate headers this way), or a
 *     string[] in some Express typings
 * In the multi-value case, the leftmost value is the original client-
 * facing host. Take that one in all forms. Exported so that app.ts
 * (clerkMiddleware callback) and this proxy middleware agree on which
 * hostname is canonical — otherwise multi-domain/custom-domain flows
 * break.

  // clerkMiddleware callback already picks CLERK_SECRET_KEY_PROD per host.

  // DOMAIN THE DAY THE TWO SECRET SLOTS WERE FILLED. It read the bare

  // proxied call. While a single slot held the sk_live the proxy happened to be
  // right; splitting the keys correctly moved that accident onto this file,
  // which nobody updated. The browser's session was then issued against the
  // development instance and verified against the production one, so /api/
  // answered 401 for everything while the public /api/languages stayed 200.
