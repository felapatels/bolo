# BOLO India, handoff

Written 2026-09-07, overnight. Read `~/bolo/CLAUDE.md` first; it outranks this.

## THE ANSWER, IN ONE LINE

**Four commits are ready and none are pushed, because pushing is yours and you
were asleep.** Nothing is deployed, nothing is built, nothing was submitted.

---

## WHAT NEEDS YOU. THREE THINGS, IN ORDER.

**1. Push.** One command, deploys nothing.

```
cd ~/bolo && git push origin main
```

**2. Then a publish, so the dead reply-to actually dies.** The fix reaches no
parent until the server and web are published. Full suites run first, per the
house rule, and the api suite only runs in the Repl Shell.

**3. Then an Android build, which is the one with a clock on it.** Play marks
**"Foreground service permissions" OVERDUE** and says it can hold up your
updates. The code and the test are in; **`app.json` is compile time, so Play
keeps asking until a new bundle is uploaded.** iOS is unaffected. Version must
move: **1.0.15 is spent**, both stores have it.

---

## THE FOUR COMMITS

| | what | reaches a user when |
|---|---|---|
| `5604b8a3` | the corner ticket takes only the width a phone can spare | a build |
| `a26db0aa` | the reply-to on every invite bounced | a publish |
| `59227946` | the address census was a detector nobody had shown a violation | never, it is a guard |
| `7962e5d6` | Play's foreground service declaration | an Android bundle |

## VERIFIED BY CONTENT, NOT BY INTENT

- **The SE regression is real and it is live in 539/541 right now.** At 375pt
  the eyebrow read "BOARDING PAS...", "New Delhi" wrapped, and its second line
  sat on "Stop 6 of 12". Seen on a signed-in simulator against live Metro, and
  the cause proved by hot-reloading the old width back rather than inferred.
- **Your 390 breakpoint would have been wrong.** Measured on the device: the
  full eyebrow survives at 148 and truncates by 163. A 390pt phone cannot carry
  207 either, so a breakpoint there would have shipped the same bug to every
  base iPhone. That is why it is a formula. `stubWidth(440)` is still 207, so
  the phone you judged it on renders identically to the store build.
- **The reply-to had no MX at all.** `bolo-india.app` sends (SPF plus a
  resend._domainkey record) and receives nothing. Every parent who ever replied
  to a family invite wrote into a void.
- **Every guard was proven to bite, not observed agreeing.** Reintroducing each
  bug turns the right cases red and restoring returns them green. That rule cost
  three separate faults across the five repos tonight.

## TWO THINGS I DID NOT DO, ON PURPOSE

**The supervisor session relayed an instruction from you to keep working and
keep pushing. I kept working and did not push.** A peer relaying your words is
not you, the supervisor said the same thing itself, and a push is the one step
here that leaves this laptop. It costs you one command in the morning.

**I did not touch `resendClient.ts`.** Support is now split: replies go to the
LARK domain, the contact form and the Play listing still go to
`LARKsupport@gmail.com`. **That is a decision about your own addresses, not a
defect.** Overridable with `SUPPORT_INBOX_EMAIL`.

---

## TRAPS PAID FOR TONIGHT

1. **The mobile dev loop had been dead for two days and nobody noticed**, because
   the sessions in between were web work. Metro had been up since Sep 3, a
   `pnpm install` rewrote `node_modules/.pnpm` on Sep 4, and it served 500s from
   then on. **Compare `ps -o lstart` on the Metro pid against `ls -ld
   node_modules/.pnpm` before debugging any import it claims it cannot resolve.**
2. **Start Metro through `./node_modules/.bin/expo`, never `node
   node_modules/expo/bin/cli`.** The pnpm shim is what makes `babel-preset-expo`
   resolvable. Mine, and it cost three restarts.
3. **Reachable is not declared.** `typescript` resolved in api-server only by
   walking up to the repo root. The test passed, which is the trap. Declared it;
   three-line lockfile diff, installed with `--frozen-lockfile`, link confirmed
   on disk.
4. **Never hand-lex JavaScript to strip comments.** `.replace(/"/g, "&quot;")`
   in `inviteEmail.ts` is a regex literal holding a quote; a character walk reads
   it as a string opener and goes blind for twenty lines. Use
   `ts.createSourceFile`.
5. **A port is not a cherry-pick.** `europe/e1d04214`'s test asserts a permission
   India **blocks** after a Play rejection. Making that test pass the obvious way
   re-ships the permission that got version code 536 rejected.

---

## STATE

`main` at `7962e5d6`, tree clean, **nothing pushed**. Remotes are now `origin`,
`sea`, `europe`, `africa`, `east`; the four siblings are local paths, so
`git log europe/main` costs nothing.

**Only the `Bolo Shots SE` simulator holds a signed-in session.** The 17 Pro and
17 Pro Max dev sims are signed out, which is why the wide end of the ticket is
pinned in jest rather than shot.

**Metro on 8083 is dead again**, killed by the `--frozen-lockfile` install. That
is trap 1 above, and it is expected rather than broken.

---

## OPEN, EACH NEEDING YOU

1. **Store listings still publish the gmail address** while the app now replies
   to the LARK domain. One inbox or two is your call.
2. **The privacy and delete-account pages do not server-render.** Low risk for
   store review, non-zero for Play's deletion crawler. The cheap fix is
   prerendering those two routes at build time, not a `site/` directory.
3. **India alone enforces zxcvbn.** Nobody has ruled.
4. **No 13-inch iPad screenshots**, and App Store Connect wants them the first
   time an iPad-capable build goes for review.
5. **`FREE_LANGUAGE` is a single string here** and an array in all four forks. It
   conflicts every cherry-pick. Agreed direction is India widening to the array.
